When the temperature is the same throughout the entire system, we consider the system to be in
thermal equilibrium.

When there is no change in pressure at any point of the system, we consider the system to be in
mechanical equilibrium.

When the chemical composition of a system does not vary with time, we consider the system to
be in chemical equilibrium.

Phase equilibrium in a two-phase system is when the mass of each phase reaches an equilibrium
level.

A thermodynamic system is said to be in thermodynamic equilibrium if it is in chemical
equilibrium, mechanical equilibrium and thermal equilibrium and the relevant parameters
cease to vary with time.
